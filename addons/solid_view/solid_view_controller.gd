## Puts Solid View on the editor's 3D viewports and takes it off again.
##
## While active, each editor camera draws with a neutral environment (a flat
## background, no fog, glow, ambient or tonemapping), neutral camera
## attributes (no exposure or auto-exposure) and a compositor carrying the
## effect, and each viewport draws unshaded when the texture colour is
## wanted. Those are only on the camera and viewport for the duration of a
## draw: [method before_draw] puts them on from
## [signal RenderingServer.frame_pre_draw] and [method after_draw] puts the
## editor's own values back from [signal RenderingServer.frame_post_draw].
## Between frames the editor sees its own state, which matters because it
## stores its View Environment toggle as "does the camera have an
## environment" in the per-scene edit state, and would otherwise save and
## replay this addon's environment as the user's choice.
##
## MSAA is the exception: changing it rebuilds the render buffers, so it stays
## off for as long as the mode is on, and is re-asserted before every draw
## because the editor puts the project's value back on a settings change.
##
## X-ray needs what the opaque pass throws away, the geometry behind the
## front surface. For it, each editor viewport gets a hidden child
## SubViewport rendering the same world from a copy of its camera in the
## editor's Overdraw debug draw, which draws every surface, regardless of
## depth, as a fixed amount of green on black. A child viewport renders before
## its parent in the same frame, so the count of surfaces under each pixel is
## current when the effect blends it in.
